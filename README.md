# AI App MVP Project

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered application MVP (Minimum Viable Product) built with Next.js and Firebase. It demonstrates the integration of artificial intelligence capabilities within a web application framework.

## Features

- Next.js frontend for a modern, responsive user interface
- Firebase backend for real-time database and authentication
- AI integration (specifics to be detailed based on the actual AI features implemented)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase account and project set up

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-app-mvp-project.git
   cd ai-app-mvp-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a `firebase-cred.json` file in the root directory with your Firebase service account credentials.
   - Ensure the `firebase-cred.json` is added to `.gitignore` to keep your credentials secure.

4. Run the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   or

   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Project Structure

- `/src`: Source code for the application
- `/public`: Static files

## Deployment

This project can be deployed on Vercel or any other platform that supports Next.js applications. Ensure that you set up the necessary environment variables for Firebase integration.

## Security Note

Be cautious with the `firebase-cred.json` file. Never commit it to version control. Use environment variables for production deployments.
